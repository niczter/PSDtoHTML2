# PSDtoHTML
This is a practice to imitate a psd and layout it via html and css. This is our second design to tackle

## Experience
The process gets easier once you get the hang of it. Since this is our second attempt, the coding was less rigorous that the first but we still had a few bumps.

## Problems
The only problem we had was time. We really wanted each detail to be perfect that's why it took us longer to finish this.

## Todos
If we were given enough time, we would definitely make an exact replica of the psd.
