# PSDtoHTML
This is a practice to imitate a psd and layout it via html and css. This is our second design to tackle

## Experience
The process gets easier once you get the hang of it. Since this is our second attempt, the coding was less rigorous that the first but we still had a few bumps.

(Update)
We've complete finished the design and it has gotten cmore accurate to the actual document. We've finished it up to the footer part.

## Problems
The only problem we had was time. We really wanted each detail to be perfect that's why it took us longer to finish this.

(Update)
Another hardship we've encountered is to "exactly" copy the size of the widths and fonts.

## Todos
If we were given enough time, we would definitely make an exact replica of the psd.

(Update)
To know how to "exactly" copy the sizes wherin when the html and the photo preview will have an uncanny difference.
